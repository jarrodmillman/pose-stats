# Context of OSE


(Look at this proposal if we can: https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2303681&HistoricalAwards=false )


## Why? Big python user base, need for stats tools in native python


* Python has large user base in general, especially in data science 
   * TODO: stats to back up
* Many students now learning python 
   * TODO: stats to back this up
* Lots of ML packages in python (pytorch/tensorflow, scikit-learn, …)
* Many domain sciences have toolboxes in Python (TODO: examples – astro, climate change, medical imaging, …)
   * Medical imaging https://monai.io/
* Stats community has historically done a lot of development in R, but has only sporadic python development
* Statisticians are more and more releasing python packages, but there is currently little support to go from research implementation to OSE


* List of examples of stats packages in python (TODO: add a bunch)
   *  https://scikit-survival.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html
   * Bin Yu has a bunch: https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~yugroup/code.html
   * https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html
   * https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html
   * https://lifelines.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
   * https://pingouin-stats.org/build/html/index.html
   * 

* List of stats methods missing/undersupported in Python
   * TODO: examples


## Where we (PIs) are starting OSE development (Where we are?)


* PIs are established in scientific python / statistics / communities
* Well positioned to lead community building effort


### YaGLM


### ISLP


### resampling-with


## Long term vision


* Community meetings (training, governance)


### Societal or national needs: 


* statistical models underpin scientific research, a domain for all science


### Guiding principles
* Community based governance
* Mimic orgs like scipy-hep, pangeo, astropy other domain stacks, a stack for statistics (bioconductor)
* Scipy-style governance




<!--
In addition to requirements specified in the PAPPG, including a separate
section labeled "Broader Impacts", both Phase I and Phase II proposals must
have a separate section titled "Context of OSE" describing the context and
vision of the proposed OSE. This required section must include a description of
the guiding principles and long-term vision for the proposed OSE, the specific
societal or national need(s) that the OSE will address, and the anticipated
broader impacts of the OSE.
