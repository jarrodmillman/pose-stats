<!--
Project Summary: The last line of the Project Summary must have a prioritized
list of 2-5 keywords that best characterize the technical field and impact area
the OSE is intended to pursue. The first keyword must denote the directorate
[Biological Sciences (specified as "BIO"), Computer and Information Science and
Engineering (CISE), Education and Human Resources (EHR), Engineering (ENG),
Geosciences (GEO), Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS), or Social,
Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE)] that most closely matches the technical
topic advanced in the OSE. The additional keywords (2-5) must be words (or
phrases) that describe the primary intended impact area for the proposed OSE â€“
e.g., "Climate Change", or "Healthcare", etc. The list should start with
"Keywords:" followed by a list of keywords separated by semi-colons (";").

Each proposal must contain a summary of the proposed project not more than one
page in length. The Project Summary consists of an overview, a statement on the
intellectual merit of the proposed activity, and a statement on the broader
impacts of the proposed activity.

The overview includes a description of the activity that would result if the
proposal were funded and a statement of objectives and methods to be employed.
The statement on intellectual merit should describe the potential of the
proposed activity to advance knowledge. The statement on broader impacts should
describe the potential of the proposed activity to benefit society and
contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.

# Overview

We propose investigating the formation of an Open Source Ecosystem (OSE) that will catalyze the development of a robust set of statistical software for Python, and build a vibrant ecosystem of statisticians, domain practitioners, and software developers around it.

Such an OSE would provide a central coordinating mechanism, through which knowledge around software engineering and community best practices can be aggregated and disseminated to statistics method developers and the researchers that apply those techniques.

To inform the design of the OSE, several meetings will be held that bring together statisticians, researchers, developers, students, and teachers.

We will investigate existing OSEs, both in the Python and R worlds, and learn from each which effective social and technological practices to adopt.

To anchor the effort, two pilot projects, with different scopes, target audiences, and levels of maturity will be audited to determine how they should be modified to comply with modern software engineering and community governance best practices.
Through this audit, we will discover the nature of activities that are valuable to support through the OSE, and that are beneficial to the statistics developer community.

Our vision for the OSE is that it will catalyze growth of a vibrant, inclusive statistical developer community in Python, that will also have repercussion more broadly as it builds bridges between scientific Python and other computational communities.
