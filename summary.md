<!--
Project Summary: The last line of the Project Summary must have a prioritized
list of 2-5 keywords that best characterize the technical field and impact area
the OSE is intended to pursue. The first keyword must denote the directorate
[Biological Sciences (specified as "BIO"), Computer and Information Science and
Engineering (CISE), Education and Human Resources (EHR), Engineering (ENG),
Geosciences (GEO), Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS), or Social,
Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE)] that most closely matches the technical
topic advanced in the OSE. The additional keywords (2-5) must be words (or
phrases) that describe the primary intended impact area for the proposed OSE â€“
e.g., "Climate Change", or "Healthcare", etc. The list should start with
"Keywords:" followed by a list of keywords separated by semi-colons (";").

Each proposal must contain a summary of the proposed project not more than one
page in length. The Project Summary consists of an overview, a statement on the
intellectual merit of the proposed activity, and a statement on the broader
impacts of the proposed activity.

The overview includes a description of the activity that would result if the
proposal were funded and a statement of objectives and methods to be employed.
The statement on intellectual merit should describe the potential of the
proposed activity to advance knowledge. The statement on broader impacts should
describe the potential of the proposed activity to benefit society and
contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.

# Overview

Generalized linear models (GLMs) play a central role in much of the statistics
employed by scientific researchers, including fields as wide as neuroimaging,
biology, chemistry, astronomy, and epidemiology.

Over the past decade, Python has become the de-facto tool for computational research.
Yet, for some applications in statistics, there are still gaps in its
ecosystem, resulting in researchers having to use multiple computational
platforms for their work.

Packages like `statsmodels` and `scipy.stats` cover much of the needed GLM
functionality, but up until now there was no sophisticated GLM implementation
that covered more advanced use cases.
Sponsored by the NSF (grant-XXXX), Iain Carmichael, in 20XX, implemented YAGLM:
a modern, comprehensive, and flexible Python package for fitting and tuning
penalized generalized linear models and other supervised M-estimators in
Python.
YAGLM has great potential to strengthen the statistical ecosystem for Python,
but much remains to be done before that can happen.

We propose bringing together domain researchers, developers, statisticians, and
Python community managers to explore what an ideal class of generalized linear
model implementations would look like.
We will use yaglm as a nucleus around which to form an Open Source Ecosystem.
This Ecosystem which will support the extension, maintenance, and governance of
the yaglm, as well as provide a structure with which other projects can
connect, or be incorporated into, to form a stable, comprehensive class of
solutions that address advanced GLM-related needs.
We also propose educating new researchers on the theoretical principles of
GLMs, so that they may better be able to apply these techniques to their work,
and also participate actively in the Ecosystem.
