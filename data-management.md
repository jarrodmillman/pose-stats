# Data Management Plan

## Types of data collected

This project does scoping activities around a proposed Open Source Ecosystem.
As such, the most prominent data artifacts include meeting notes and feedback from users, researchers, and students.
Some work may be done on two open source pilot projects, YAGLM and ISLP, to learn the nature of improvements needed.
This process may result in assessments on governance structure, technical infrastructure, and software engineering best practices.
The information from these documents may be included in a draft grant proposal for Phase II.

## Dissemination of data

All meeting notes, anonymized feedback, design documentation, assessments, and proposals generated will be developed (and remain) in public.
The work will either appear on GitHub in repositories affiliated with the OSE, or on a public website.

## Licensing of data

Any data artifacts gathered will be published under the CC0 (https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/) license.
Feedback gathered on the needs of statistical software will *not* include any identifiable private information.
All participants to meetings and surveys will be informed of the data management plan prior to participating.
Although code is not part of the purview of this grant, any code produced as a side-effect will be published under the Modified BSD License.

## Data retention

The data gathered is functional in helping to establish and OSE and to improve the ecosystem of statistical software in Python.
As such, other than the procedures mentioned (publishing data on GitHub and websites), no long term archival of data is planned.
