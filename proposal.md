# POSE: Phase I: An open-source ecosystem for statistical Python

<!-- https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2023/nsf23556/nsf23556.htm#prep -->

<!--
Title: Proposal titles must begin with "POSE:" and the Phase followed by a colon (":"), and then the title of the project. For example, a proposal to Phase I would have a title of the form POSE: Phase I: Title.

Project Summary: The last line of the Project Summary must have a prioritized list of 2-5 keywords that best characterize the technical field and impact area the OSE is intended to pursue. The first keyword must denote the directorate [Biological Sciences (specified as "BIO"), Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), Education and Human Resources (EHR), Engineering (ENG), Geosciences (GEO), Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS), or Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE)] that most closely matches the technical topic advanced in the OSE. The additional keywords (2-5) must be words (or phrases) that describe the primary intended impact area for the proposed OSE â€“ e.g., "Climate Change", or "Healthcare", etc. The list should start with "Keywords:" followed by a list of keywords separated by semi-colons (";").

Project Description: Describe the activities to be undertaken in up to 7 pages for Phase I proposals and up to 15 pages for Phase II proposals. See Section II. Program Description, in this solicitation for guidance.

In addition to requirements specified in the PAPPG, including a separate section labeled "Broader Impacts", both Phase I and Phase II proposals must have a separate section titled "Context of OSE" describing the context and vision of the proposed OSE. This required section must include a description of the guiding principles and long-term vision for the proposed OSE, the specific societal or national need(s) that the OSE will address, and the anticipated broader impacts of the OSE.
