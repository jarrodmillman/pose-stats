# POSE: Phase I: An open-source ecosystem for statistical Python

<!-- https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2023/nsf23556/nsf23556.htm#prep -->

<!--
Title: Proposal titles must begin with "POSE:" and the Phase followed by a colon (":"), and then the title of the project.
For example, a proposal to Phase I would have a title of the form POSE: Phase I: Title.
-->

## Project Summary

<!--
Project Summary: The last line of the Project Summary must have a prioritized
list of 2-5 keywords that best characterize the technical field and impact area
the OSE is intended to pursue. The first keyword must denote the directorate
[Biological Sciences (specified as "BIO"), Computer and Information Science and
Engineering (CISE), Education and Human Resources (EHR), Engineering (ENG),
Geosciences (GEO), Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS), or Social,
Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE)] that most closely matches the technical
topic advanced in the OSE. The additional keywords (2-5) must be words (or
phrases) that describe the primary intended impact area for the proposed OSE â€“
e.g., "Climate Change", or "Healthcare", etc. The list should start with
"Keywords:" followed by a list of keywords separated by semi-colons (";").

## Project Description

<!--
Project Description: Describe the activities to be undertaken in up to 7 pages
for Phase I proposals and up to 15 pages for Phase II proposals. See Section
II. Program Description, in this solicitation for guidance.
-->

### Context of OSE

<!--
In addition to requirements specified in the PAPPG, including a separate
section labeled "Broader Impacts", both Phase I and Phase II proposals must
have a separate section titled "Context of OSE" describing the context and
vision of the proposed OSE. This required section must include a description of
the guiding principles and long-term vision for the proposed OSE, the specific
societal or national need(s) that the OSE will address, and the anticipated
broader impacts of the OSE.
-->

### Ecosystem Discovery

<!--
Include a plan for developing a strategy that: (1) describes methods to
evaluate and justify the need for the innovation within the current
technological landscape; (2) explains why an OSE is the right approach to
further develop the technology; and (3) outlines methods to identify potential
users who will utilize this technology.
-->

### Organization and Governance

<!--
Describe specific activities and their rationale that will identify: (1) the
appropriate organizational, coordination, and governance models including the
licensing approach to be employed; (2) the specific continuous development and
integration processes and infrastructure that is most suitable for open,
asynchronous, and distributed development of the open-source product, (3)
processes for ensuring quality, security, privacy or ethical concerns of new
content; and (4) the best methods for sustaining the organizational structure,
including metrics to assess and evaluate long-term success of the development
methodology, support for users, and on-boarding mechanisms for new
contributors.
-->

### Community Building

<!--
Describe the specific activities to engage potential users and intellectual
content developers, including: (1) identification of the specific research and
development capabilities required of the potential contributor communities; and
(2) mechanisms to engage these communities (e.g., workshops, hackathons,
competitions, research coordination networks, and Ideas Labs).
-->

### Intellectual Merit

<!--
The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge;
-->

### Results from Prior NSF Support

### Broader Impacts

<!--
The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and
contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.
-->


<!--

Phase I proposals will be evaluated on the basis of the following solicitation-specific review criteria:

- Does the proposal present a convincing case that the OSE will address an issue of significant societal or national importance that is not currently being adequately addressed?
- Does the proposal clearly describe the long-term vision for the OSE, including potential partnerships and sustainability?
- Does the proposal provide convincing evidence that a substantial user base exists, or could be built, for the open-source product that will be the subject of the OSE?
- Does the proposal justify the OSE within the current technological landscape and present a strong case that an OSE is the best approach for generating impact?
- Does the proposal present clear plans for discovering the ecosystem within which the OSE will be operating?
- Does the proposal present a credible plan for exploring the establishment of a sustainable organizational structure?
- Does the proposal present a credible plan to develop a strategy for building a community of contributors?
- Does the proposing team have the required expertise and experience to undertake the Phase I activities described in the solicitation?
- Will NSF support serve as a critical catalyst for the establishment of the OSE?
- Does the proposal include third-party letters of collaboration from current users of the open-source product that is the subject of the OSE?
