# Context of OSE

<!--
In addition to requirements specified in the PAPPG, including a separate
section labeled "Broader Impacts", both Phase I and Phase II proposals must
have a separate section titled "Context of OSE" describing the context and
vision of the proposed OSE. This required section must include a description of
the guiding principles and long-term vision for the proposed OSE, the specific
societal or national need(s) that the OSE will address, and the anticipated
broader impacts of the OSE.
-->

# Ecosystem Discovery

<!--
Include a plan for developing a strategy that: (1) describes methods to
evaluate and justify the need for the innovation within the current
technological landscape; (2) explains why an OSE is the right approach to
further develop the technology; and (3) outlines methods to identify potential
users who will utilize this technology.
-->

# Organization and Governance

<!--
Describe specific activities and their rationale that will identify: (1) the
appropriate organizational, coordination, and governance models including the
licensing approach to be employed; (2) the specific continuous development and
integration processes and infrastructure that is most suitable for open,
asynchronous, and distributed development of the open-source product, (3)
processes for ensuring quality, security, privacy or ethical concerns of new
content; and (4) the best methods for sustaining the organizational structure,
including metrics to assess and evaluate long-term success of the development
methodology, support for users, and on-boarding mechanisms for new
contributors.
-->

# Community Building

<!--
Describe the specific activities to engage potential users and intellectual
content developers, including: (1) identification of the specific research and
development capabilities required of the potential contributor communities; and
(2) mechanisms to engage these communities (e.g., workshops, hackathons,
competitions, research coordination networks, and Ideas Labs).
-->

# Intellectual Merit

<!--
The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge;
-->

# Results from Prior NSF Support

# Broader Impacts

<!--
The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and
contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.

Phase I proposals will be evaluated on the basis of the following solicitation-specific review criteria:

- Does the proposal present a convincing case that the OSE will address an issue of significant societal or national importance that is not currently being adequately addressed?
- Does the proposal clearly describe the long-term vision for the OSE, including potential partnerships and sustainability?
- Does the proposal provide convincing evidence that a substantial user base exists, or could be built, for the open-source product that will be the subject of the OSE?
- Does the proposal justify the OSE within the current technological landscape and present a strong case that an OSE is the best approach for generating impact?
- Does the proposal present clear plans for discovering the ecosystem within which the OSE will be operating?
- Does the proposal present a credible plan for exploring the establishment of a sustainable organizational structure?
- Does the proposal present a credible plan to develop a strategy for building a community of contributors?
- Does the proposing team have the required expertise and experience to undertake the Phase I activities described in the solicitation?
- Will NSF support serve as a critical catalyst for the establishment of the OSE?
- Does the proposal include third-party letters of collaboration from current users of the open-source product that is the subject of the OSE?
