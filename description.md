Project Description: Describe the activities to be undertaken in up to 7 pages
for Phase I proposals and up to 15 pages for Phase II proposals. See Section
II. Program Description, in this solicitation for guidance.

# Context of OSE

<!--
Look at this proposal if we can: https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2303681&HistoricalAwards=false
-->

## Motivation 

Why? Big python user base, need for stats tools in native python

* Python has large user base in general, especially in data science
   * TODO: stats to back up
* Many students now learning python
   * TODO: stats to back this up
* Lots of ML packages in python (pytorch/tensorflow, scikit-learn, …)
* Many domain sciences have toolboxes in Python (TODO: examples – astro, climate change, medical imaging, …)
   * Medical imaging https://monai.io/
* Stats community has historically done a lot of development in R, but has only sporadic python development
* Statisticians are more and more releasing python packages, but there is currently little support to go from research implementation to OSE


* List of examples of stats packages in python (TODO: add a bunch)
   *  https://scikit-survival.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html
   * Bin Yu has a bunch: https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~yugroup/code.html
   * https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html
   * https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html
   * https://lifelines.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
   * https://pingouin-stats.org/build/html/index.html

* List of stats methods missing/undersupported in Python
   * TODO: examples

## Where we (PIs) are starting OSE development (Where we are?)

* PIs are established in scientific python / statistics / communities
* Well positioned to lead community building effort


### YaGLM


### ISLP


### resampling-with


## Long term vision

* Community meetings (training, governance)


### Societal or national needs: 

* statistical models underpin scientific research, a domain for all science

### Guiding principles

* Community based governance
  * Scientific Python-style governance
* Mimic orgs like scipy-hep, pangeo, astropy other domain stacks, a stack for statistics (bioconductor)

<!--
In addition to requirements specified in the PAPPG, including a separate
section labeled "Broader Impacts", both Phase I and Phase II proposals must
have a separate section titled "Context of OSE" describing the context and
vision of the proposed OSE. This required section must include a description of
the guiding principles and long-term vision for the proposed OSE, the specific
societal or national need(s) that the OSE will address, and the anticipated
broader impacts of the OSE.
-->

# Ecosystem Discovery

<!--
Include a plan for developing a strategy that: (1) describes methods to
evaluate and justify the need for the innovation within the current
technological landscape; (2) explains why an OSE is the right approach to
further develop the technology; and (3) outlines methods to identify potential
users who will utilize this technology.
-->

# Organization and Governance

<!--
Describe specific activities and their rationale that will identify: (1) the
appropriate organizational, coordination, and governance models including the
licensing approach to be employed; (2) the specific continuous development and
integration processes and infrastructure that is most suitable for open,
asynchronous, and distributed development of the open-source product, (3)
processes for ensuring quality, security, privacy or ethical concerns of new
content; and (4) the best methods for sustaining the organizational structure,
including metrics to assess and evaluate long-term success of the development
methodology, support for users, and on-boarding mechanisms for new
contributors.
-->

# Community Building

<!--
Describe the specific activities to engage potential users and intellectual
content developers, including: (1) identification of the specific research and
development capabilities required of the potential contributor communities; and
(2) mechanisms to engage these communities (e.g., workshops, hackathons,
competitions, research coordination networks, and Ideas Labs).
-->

# Intellectual Merit

<!--
The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge;
-->

# Results from Prior NSF Support

# Broader Impacts

<!--
The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and
contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.
-->


<!--

Phase I proposals will be evaluated on the basis of the following solicitation-specific review criteria:

- Does the proposal present a convincing case that the OSE will address an issue of significant societal or national importance that is not currently being adequately addressed?
- Does the proposal clearly describe the long-term vision for the OSE, including potential partnerships and sustainability?
- Does the proposal provide convincing evidence that a substantial user base exists, or could be built, for the open-source product that will be the subject of the OSE?
- Does the proposal justify the OSE within the current technological landscape and present a strong case that an OSE is the best approach for generating impact?
- Does the proposal present clear plans for discovering the ecosystem within which the OSE will be operating?
- Does the proposal present a credible plan for exploring the establishment of a sustainable organizational structure?
- Does the proposal present a credible plan to develop a strategy for building a community of contributors?
- Does the proposing team have the required expertise and experience to undertake the Phase I activities described in the solicitation?
- Will NSF support serve as a critical catalyst for the establishment of the OSE?
- Does the proposal include third-party letters of collaboration from current users of the open-source product that is the subject of the OSE?
