    Abstract: This abstract will be linked to your project on the NSF award
    search website for the public (including Congress) and our scientific peers to
    peruse. An NSF abstract is a public record of an award that describes the
    project and justifies expenditure of Federal (taxpayer) funds and should convey
    both the intellectual merit and the broader impacts of the project. The
    abstracts are available to a wide audience and must be written accordingly.
    They are also distributed on request to members of Congress, the media, and
    others who may not have training in science.

    The abstract should contain two paragraphs, and we prefer that it is
    written in the present tense. The first paragraph is a non-technical
    explanation of the project’s broader significance and importance, for a lay
    audience. The first sentence might open with the primary potential benefit of
    the research (1-3 sentences that clearly describe the broader questions or
    issues the project aims to address; what about this project might impress or
    inspire a public audience; why this a good taxpayer is investment). It can also
    include the primary activity the awardee plans to carry out during the project.
    This paragraph should be written at about a 12th grade reading level.

    The second paragraph is a more technical description of the project, but
    this should also be widely accessible (if not at a 12th grade reading level,
    certainly no higher than lower college reading level). State the problem to be
    studied. State the goals and scope of the research, the theoretical framing,
    the methods, and the data analytic approaches to be used. Reflect the project’s
    goals as they may have been modified in the review process but avoid the
    lower-level details that would only mean anything to a very sophisticated
    technical/research audience (leave that to the ensuing journal articles!).

    Please send us a draft of the abstract as an MS-Word or plain text document
    via email. We will use your suggested draft to formulate the final text, which
    is likely to be edited by NSF staff before the award recommendation is
    finalized. Writing a document for public, lay-audience consumption can take
    time can care - this is not a typical journal article abstract. If you would
    like to see examples for public abstracts from awards from our program, please
    access the award search website and search for the POSE program.


NSF award abstracts should:

 Explain the project's significance and importance; and

 Serve as a public justification for NSF funding by articulating how the
 project serves the national interest, as embodied by the NSF's mission: to
 serve the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity and
 welfare; or to secure the national defense.

POSE: Phase 1: An open-source ecosystem for statistical Python (TI - 2346273)

Python and R are the two most popular computational platforms in academia and industry, driving innovation in data science and AI.
R is largely developed by statisticians, while scientific Python is mostly built by researchers from the applied sciences.
As a consequence, Python's statistical capabilities are lacking, and statisticians do not benefit from widespread use of their algorithmic innovations on this popular platform.
This Phase 1 project explores sustainable and effective pathways for establishing an open-source ecosystem to foster the growth of statistical software, as well as its surrounding developer community, in Python.
<!--
to catalyze the development of a robust set of statistical software for Python,
and build a vibrant ecosystem of statisticians, domain practitioners, and software developers around it.
-->

To anchor the effort, we focus on two pilot projects, with different scopes, target audiences, and levels of maturity
to determine how they should be modified to comply with modern software engineering and community governance best practices.
YAGLM is an open-source Python package that makes modern generalized linear models (GLM) available and easily accessible to data scientists.
GLMs are a flexible and powerful generalization of ordinary linear regression and cover many statistical models widely used in applications.
The ISLP open-source Python package accompanies the new introductory text on statistical learning and Python ("An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in Python," which closely follows the examples in its hugely successful R version).
In addition to providing course assignments, it provides an intuitive interface for design matrix building, a simple implementation of Bayesian Additive Regression Trees, and object oriented stepwise model selection.
